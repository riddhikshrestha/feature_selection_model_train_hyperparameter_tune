## STEPS ##

1. Divide the features based on indepenednt and dependent features
2. Train test split of the dataset
3. Standardize the dataset  # to make all dependent and indepenednt features to scale down to make same in order to train model quickly and reach
at optimizaton as fast as possible. e.g. here height is measure in inches and weight is in kg,pound, if you use original data into model then model will took 
too much time to come to it's Global Minima Points i.e. Gradient Descent or optimzation happen quickly
4. Train the model using Linear Regression
